# DApp Dev Club

## Delivering results
Create a repository on GitHub and name it `DAppDevClubHomework`. Every homework will have it’s own file structure. I.E. first week homework should be 2 files `SimpleAuction.sol` and `SimpleAuctionInterface.sol`. For each week you will receive the instructions for structuring your project.

Please, consider using [git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). Use [`Semantic Versioning`](https://semver.org/) as a convention. I.E. your week 1 homework should be of `1.y.z` version (where `y` & `z` is any digit), your week 2 homework should be `2.y.z` and so on. Every new week homework should increment a major version.

Be sure to complete your homework 2 days before the lesson (Deadline: Thursday 10:00 EET).

Please, send us your public GitHub repo link in the mail body only once to this email address: hello@dappdev.org with subject `Club GitHub Repo – {Your Slack Name}`.
